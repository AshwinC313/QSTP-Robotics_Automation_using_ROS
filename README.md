# QSTP-Robotics_Automation_using_ROS

All material regarding the *Robotics Automation using ROS* QSTP 2020 is sorted weekwise in this repo.  
Each week has an associated README containing further instructions and resources.  

### Introduction to the Course
 

Automation and Control in Robotics is a fast growing field with exciting innovations
coming out with a rapid pace (check out [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmNaLtC6vkU) & [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sBBaNYex3E)). In this course we hope to familiarise
you with the basic tools and techniques that are at the core of such developments.

The course begins from scratch by covering the basics of Python including branching,
looping, basic I/O and functions. The key tool you will be learning in the course is the
Robotics Operating System (ROS) - a software framework designed to make robotics
development easier. Along with this you will also be working with Gazebo which is a
robotics simulator where you can create your own robot models or even test out code
on pre existing Turtlebot.

The final project is creating an autonomous ground robot, this will involve combining
the tasks you will do over the course of the 6 weeks. You will be given a map of an
environment with some obstacles. Your task is to first plan a path from start to goal
through the environment using one of the path planning algorithms you will have
learned. You will then need to write a controller for a robot that you created (or a pre
existing model in Gazebo) to traverse the path point by point to reach the goal.
